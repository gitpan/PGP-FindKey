Status:

Initial release of PGP::FindKey.  Suggestions/bug reports/patches
greatly appreciated.

Description:

This perl module is an interface to the PGP WWW keyservers.  It allows
an e-mail address to be passed to it, and will return a keyid if there
is a distinct match for the address.

Installation:

This module needs the following modules, all available from CPAN:

 HTTP::Request    (in the libwww-perl bundle)
 LWP::UserAgent   (in the libwww-perl bundle)
 URI::Escape

Usual CPAN installation rules apply:

        perl Makefile.PL 
        make
	make test
        make install

There is documentation - including sample usage - in FindKey.pm itself.
